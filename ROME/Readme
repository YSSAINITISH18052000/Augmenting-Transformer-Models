## Rank-One Model Editing (ROME)

Welcome to the Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) repository! This project provides an implementation of ROME on auto-regressive transformers (GPU-only), supporting models such as OpenAI's GPT-2 XL (1.5B) and EleutherAI's GPT-J (6B).
Feel free to open an issue if you encounter any problems; we are actively developing this repository and will closely monitor all tickets.
